=====

This is our implementation of the classic tanks game. 
Corresponds to our 3rd attemp at recreating classic games while learning the Python language (here's the [1st](https://github.com/PedroNCordeiro/pongy) and [2nd](https://github.com/PedroNCordeiro/snakey)).


### Game controls
Z - Decrease shot power  
X - Increase shot power  
{Left, Right} Arrows - Move tanks  
{Up, Down} Arrows - Change shot angle
